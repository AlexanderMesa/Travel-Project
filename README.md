# Travel-Project
Enter a starting destination and a final destination, and you will get price information for flights and hotels. You can input cities or airports. It uses a Google Maps API to get the latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates based on a city or place. It also uses Amadeus API to find the nearest airport and hotel costs based on the coordinates and check in/out dates. 
You can log in or out with your email thanks to Firebase Authentication.

Right now, there is something wrong with the Amadeus API request. The app is currently not working, but I am working on it.

My Responsibilities:

Wrote the code for it to find your location.
Changed the color scheme of the map to match the theme of the website.
Got the Firebase Authentication working to handle logging in and out.
Added a loading icon so users know to wait for the price data.

# Travel-Project
Enter a starting destination and a final destination, and you will get price information for flights and hotels. You can input cities or airports. 
It can even find your location for you. 
You can log in or out with your email.

My Responsibilities:

Wrote the code for it to find your location.
Changed the color scheme of the map to match the theme of the website.
Got the Firebase Authentication working to handle logging in and out.
Added a loading icon so users know to wait for the price data.
